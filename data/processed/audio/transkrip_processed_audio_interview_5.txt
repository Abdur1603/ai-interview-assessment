[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  Describe the process of building more conversational, more conversational for image as fiction, okay, the CNN run, right, so at the first time of course we need to make sure there are split, the image folder split it for each class, okay,
[00:28.000 --> 00:57.000]  and then we can use Keras preprocessing, I found a mistake on image dataset from directory to split the training and the validation dataset, right, yeah, of course we can use another set which is the test dataset, yeah, but yeah, okay, the next one, we can, yeah, we can just, maybe we need to implement
[00:58.000 --> 01:27.000]  also the image augmentation, yeah, data image data augmentation tool to make our dataset more variative, for example like we can rotate, we can zoom it, we can crop it, yeah, and yeah, the last thing, yeah, of course we can build our CNN model with the conversational 2D, specify the filters, the kernel size,
[01:27.000 --> 01:53.000]  the elevation of course, the input shape for the first layer, and then we can apply the next pooling 2D, yeah, and the next layer we can just use conversational 2D, next pooling, and whatever it is, and after that we apply the flatten layer, and robot layer if you want,
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  and the last thing, don't forget to use the next layer, right, for the output, like the last output,
