(0:05) Hi, I'm Ria. Thank you for coming to interview with us today. Let's just go 
(0:09) ahead and get started with a quick introduction.Could you tell me a little
(0:12) bit about yourself? Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thank you so much for having me. 
(0:16) It's an honor to be here.So a bit about myself, I'm originally from Morocco 
(0:20) where I lived pretty much my whole life. I then came to Boston and studied
(0:24) industrial engineering at Northeastern University. While I was in college, I did
(0:28) a few different internships.I did technical ones at a local power plant 
(0:31) and at Amazon Robotics, and I also did one in consulting at the Boston
(0:35) Consulting Group, and was also the president of the consulting club at my
(0:38) university. So really I'm someone who enjoys both the business side of things, 
(0:42) but I also do have a passion for technology. So down the line, my goal is 
(0:47) to start my own education technology company in my home country, Morocco, so I 
(0:50) can make education more affordable through the use of tech.And outside of (0:55) like school and work, I also do magic tricks on college campuses. Oh wow, that 
(0:59) sounds like a very impressive background. So why exactly are you interested in
(1:04) interviewing with our consulting firm? Yeah, my reasons for joining your 
(1:08) consulting firm are twofold.Number one, I think the exposure to the strategy work 
(1:12) is very appealing to me. And then second, the opportunities for externship is also 
(1:16) one that I'm highly looking at. So on the strategy side, I know that your 
(1:19) consulting firm is one of the few that gives you exposure to C-suite executives 
(1:23) and to strategy type projects early on in your career, which is something that I
(1:27) don't find at other companies.Then the second reason is the opportunity to do
(1:31) externships. So as I mentioned, I am interested in the education sector down
(1:34) the line, and I know that your company offers the opportunity to work for six
(1:37) months at a public sector type company or a nonprofit out in Africa focused on 
(1:42) education. So I think those are some of the things that highly appeal to me in 
(1:45) your company.Okay, awesome. That's good to know. So now we'll dive into a little 
(1:50) bit more behavioral questions.So could you tell me about a time where you 
(1:54) solved a difficult problem? That's a good question. I think the moment that I 
(1:58) can think of is when I was working at the electrical power plant. We were trying
(2:02) to launch a new department, and my task was to essentially source a supplier.
(2:07) Typically we work with a supplier of generators from France, but this time
(2:10) around their capacity and also their pricing did not match our budget and
(2:14) what we were looking for. So what I ended up doing is I ended up creating a large
(2:18) list of all the different suppliers that are out there, and then I found a supplier 
(2:22) in South Korea that I negotiated with and also was able to bring them in and 
(2:26) implement all of the new generator technology. So that was able to save us
(2:30) a total cost of 10% from the total project, and it was a huge success at the
(2:35) end of it.Awesome, thank you for sharing that. So next, could you tell me about 
(2:39) like one or two of your key strengths? So I would say the biggest two would 
(2:44) probably be my ability to persuade people, and then the second would be 
(2:48) leadership. I would say those are the biggest two.Okay, so could you dive a (2:52) little more into that first one, your ability to persuade people? Maybe tell
(2:55) me about a time you were able to convince someone to change their mind.
(2:59) Yeah, so what I can think of is when I was working at Amazon, one of the big 
(3:03) projects that we're trying to launch is the first new robotic facility, but it 
(3:07) came at a time when COVID had just hit and I was unable to essentially source a 
(3:12) lot of the material that we typically get from our Japanese supplier. So the
(3:16) vice president of supply chain at the time, his executive decision was to push 
(3:20) the launch and push it out for a few months.Instead, what I decided to do is
(3:25) try to see if there's a way to still keep the launch at the same time, and I 
(3:29) looked at some of our existing facilities already and try to source 
(3:32) some of the unused material from there so that we don't delay the launch. So 
(3:36) initially, the VP of supply chain wanted to delay the launch, but through the
(3:39) analysis, through explaining to him that we could source it from the other 
(3:42) facilities, I was able to convince him to not delay the launch and instead change 
(3:47) the strategy to still be able to get the facility right out on time.
(3:50) Okay, great.So now we'll dive into that second strength you had mentioned. Could 
(3:55) you tell me about a time that you demonstrated strong leadership skills?
(3:59) Yeah, the one that I can think of is when I was working at the Boston 
(4:03) Consulting Group. There, I was leading a big real estate occupancy project where 
4:08) I wanted to essentially showcase what the attendance of each office looked 
(4:11) like.What I had to do was then automate the process for a lot of the partners so 
(4:15) that they have a dashboard that they can manipulate and change and 
(4:18) look at the data. So I had to work with a large team of 15 different developers, 
(4:22) software engineers, and data engineers. So I worked with them to essentially gather
(4:26) the data, clean the data, and process it and put it and visualize it through 
(4:30) Tableau.So that was a great opportunity where I was essentially working with 
(4:33) different teams, putting game plans, putting timelines for them, and as I 
(4:38) mentioned, at the end of it, it was a very strong project and the partners were 
(4:40) very happy with the dashboard. And it was a good managerial experience for 
(4:44) me at the time as well. Awesome, that sounds like a very worthwhile experience.
(4:48) So now that we've talked a little bit about your strengths, maybe you could
(4:51) tell me about a weakness that you face in the workforce? Yeah, I'd say the biggest 
(4:56) one is probably my ability to prioritize when there's a lot of conflicting and 
(5:00) competing priorities. The big one in that case would be when say there's three or 
(5:05) four different projects and all of them are high urgency or high priority. 
(5:09) Sometimes as someone who's still very junior in their career, I still don't 
(5:12) have that business sense on which one I should tackle first, but I've been
(5:15) trying to improve on it and work on it.So what I do now is I typically just 
(5:18) chat with my manager and try to understand where the business focus
(5:22) should be. I sometimes even just directly ask on how I should prioritize some of
(5:26) the work. So I have been improving on that a little bit and I think with some 
(5:29) seniority I will hopefully be able to get there and understand what I should 
(5:32) start with first.Okay, definitely makes sense. So those are all the questions
(5:37) that I had for you today. Before we end, do you have any questions for me? Yeah, I 
(5:42) think I have two big questions.I think the first one is as you know there's a
(5:46) lot of big push for like the remote workforce right now and as a consulting
(5:51) company there's a lot of work working directly with clients or coming in in 
(5:54) person to visit the clients. Do you think that the consulting business model would 
(5:57) necessarily change now that we are in a remote environment? I think that's a big 
(6:02) one. And then the second question that I had for you is what are kind of the big 
(6:06) goals of your consulting company by say 2025? What are the big milestones that 
(6:10) you guys are hoping to achieve and is say international expansion one of those 
(6:13) big milestones that you're looking at? Great, so I think Ziad did an amazing job 
(6:20) with that interview.There are four main things that I think he did really well. 
(6:24) First, he was very poised and confident throughout the entire interview. We were
(6:29) going back and forth and I was asking him a lot of questions but he came back 
(6:32) very prepared for each question.Second, he used the STAR method very well. I could 
(6:38) really understand the situation, task, action, and result and he introduced each 
(6:43) story in a way that made me understand what he was saying. Third, he was very 
(6:48) concise in each of his stories.And lastly, he ended with some very thoughtful 
(6:53) questions that made it seem like he really cared about the company and the
(6:57) position. Overall, Ziad did a great job and I would accelerate him to the next round.
