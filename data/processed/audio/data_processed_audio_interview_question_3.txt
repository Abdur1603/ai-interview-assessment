Wait, what is this?
Describe a complex tensor form model you have built and the steps you took to ensure its
accuracy and efficiency.
Complex tensor form model you have built and steps you took to ensure its accuracy.
Okay, I will take one of my previous project that I use.
Yeah, I also use Keras tensor form model.
It is about a shell that this is prediction, yeah, yeah, this is also I use the research
project for my undergraduate thesis, yeah, for my script C and I use this model.
It's quite challenging even though it's achieved high accuracy with some dense layer, yeah,
with some throughout layer and trial and error also with the callback function, yeah,
with the neurons but the problem is the dataset is not balanced, yeah.
So it has the invalid class datasets, yeah, and the process I use is just to use the technique
called SMOPE and synthetic over sampling technique with edited nearest neighbor, yeah, which is
basically just over sampling and under sampling the datasets, yeah, it helps with the accuracy.
